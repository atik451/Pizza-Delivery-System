You have chosen Chicago Pizza!!
History:
Chicago pizza, also commonly referred to as deep-dish pizza, gets its name from the city it was invented in. 
During the early 1900â€™s, Italian immigrants in the windy city were searching for something similar to the Neapolitan pizza that they knew and loved. 
Instead of imitating the notoriously thin pie, Ike Sewell had something else in mind.
